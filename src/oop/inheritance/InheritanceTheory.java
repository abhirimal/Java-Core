    1. What is inheritance ?
    Ans: Inheritance is a process by which a child class acquires the properties of a parent class.
         In OOP, it provides the idea of reusability i.e. we can add additional features to an
         existing class without modifying it.
         The new child class will have the combined features of both the classes i.e. parent class and
         its own.
    2. Why do we need inheritance ?
    Ans: We need inheritance for code reusability. It also helps us to achieve method overriding.

    3. What are the types of inheritance and which types of inheritance is supported in java ?
    Ans: There are 5 types of inheritance. They are:
    i) Single inheritance               ii) Multiple Inheritance
    iii) Multilevel Inheritance         iv) Hierarchical Inheritance
    v) Hybrid Inheritance

    All types of multiple inheritance is supported in Java. However, it doesn't support multiple
    inheritance in classes. We can implement multiple inheritance by using interface.

    4. Explain all the inheritance types in java.
    i) Single inheritance
    Ans: A single child class is derived by a single parent class.

    ii) Multiple Inheritance
    Ans:A single child class is derived by two or more parent class.

    iii) Multilevel Inheritance
    Ans: In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.
         It should contain atleast 3 levels.

    iv) Hierarchical Inheritance
    Ans: Multiple child classes are dervied from a single parent class.

    v) Hybrid Inheritance
    Ans: It is formed by the combination of two or more inheritances.

    5. Can we extend more than one class in java ?
    Ans: Yes, we can extend more than one class in java.

    6. What is the use of super keywords ?
    Ans: The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent
         class object.

    7. Can  we access the subclass method using superclass objects ?
    Ans: No it is not possible. A superclass has no knowledge of its subclasses.

    8. Why is multiple inheritance not supported in java ?
    Ans: Multiple Inheritance is not supported in java because it leads to a diamond problem.
         We can implement multiple inheritance by using interface.
