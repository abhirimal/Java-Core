    2. What will be the output of the following program.

    public class Time {
        int a = 50;
        int b = 10;
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            a += b--;
            System.out.println(a);
    }

    Ans : There will be compilation error because we are trying to access the
          variables of class from a main method without creating objects.
